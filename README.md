# mini-shakespeare
This project demonstrates a GPT model trained on a mini Shakespeare dataset. The model is designed to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare, leveraging the patterns, structure, and vocabulary found in the dataset.

Features
Text Generation: Create Shakespearean-style monologues, dialogues, or sonnets.
Custom Prompt Support: Input a phrase or a few lines, and the model generates text in Shakespeare's distinctive style.
Lightweight Dataset: Trained on a small subset of Shakespeare's works, making it a quick and efficient project.
Dataset
The dataset consists of a selection of Shakespeare's works, including:

Excerpts from plays (e.g., Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet).
Sonnets and poems.
The dataset has been preprocessed to remove extraneous metadata (e.g., act/scene markers) and normalized for training.

Model Details
Base Model: GPT architecture.
Training: Fine-tuned on the mini Shakespeare dataset for a limited number of epochs.
Output Style: Generates iambic pentameter-like text with a Shakespearean vocabulary and structure.
